This Hangman game code is a simple implementation in Python that allows a player to guess a hidden word letter by letter. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of how it works:

### Code Breakdown

1. **Imports**:
   - `import random`: This module is imported to allow the program to select a random word from a predefined list.

2. **Function Definition**:
   - `def hangman():`: The main function that contains all the game logic.

3. **Word Selection**:
   - `words = ["python", "java", "kotlin", "javascript", "hangman"]`: A list of words from which a random word will be chosen.
   - `word = random.choice(words)`: Selects one word randomly from the list.

4. **Initial Setup**:
   - `guessed_word = "_" * len(word)`: Creates a string of underscores that matches the length of the chosen word, representing unguessed letters.
   - `tries = 6`: Sets the number of incorrect guesses allowed before losing the game.
   - `guessed_letters = []`: Initializes an empty list to keep track of letters that the player has guessed.

5. **Game Loop**:
   - `while tries > 0 and "_" in guessed_word:`: The loop continues as long as there are tries left and there are still unguessed letters.
     - **Display Current State**: The current state of the word and the remaining tries are printed.
     - **User Input**: The player is prompted to guess a letter, which is converted to lowercase.
     - **Input Validation**:
       - **Repeated Guess**: If the letter has already been guessed, a message is displayed.
       - **Correct Guess**: If the guessed letter is in the word:
         - The letter is added to `guessed_letters`.
         - The `guessed_word` is updated to show the correctly guessed letters.
       - **Incorrect Guess**: If the guessed letter is not in the word:
         - The letter is added to `guessed_letters`.
         - The number of tries is decremented, and a message indicates the incorrect guess.

6. **Game Conclusion**:
   - After the loop ends, the game checks whether the player has successfully guessed the word or not:
     - If there are no underscores left in `guessed_word`, the player is congratulated.
     - If the player runs out of tries, a game-over message is displayed, revealing the correct word.

### Summary

The Hangman game is an interactive console application where a player guesses a hidden word by suggesting letters within a limited number of attempts. The game uses a straightforward loop to manage guesses, checks for correct and incorrect inputs, and updates the display accordingly. It emphasizes user interaction, simple logic, and basic data structures, making it a great example for beginners to learn programming concepts in Python.
